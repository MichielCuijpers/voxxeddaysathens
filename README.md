### How to get started with better Code Hub! 

With Better Code Hub, you can check how good your team's code scores compared with the state of the art in software engineering. If Better Code Hub says you're compliant (‚úÖ) then it means you're performing like the top teams in the industry. It checks for compliance with 10 guidelines for Maintainable Software. 

![10 guidelines](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1440/1*TS-ZTeI7sQS7dy_AlMqSXQ.png)

The guidelines are described in full in the book [‚ÄúBuilding Maintainable Software‚Äù](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049159.do) Compliance to the guidelines is derived from the Software Improvement Group's industry benchmark (8 billion lines of code, over 180 technologies). 

## Supported Languages

## Excluding files from analysis

Better Code Hub analyses all the code that is in your repository. This might include all the external libraries that you use. 

First do an initial analysis of your repository, so the "Analysis configuration" option becomes available. Then you can exclude these files by creating a **.bettercodehub.yml** configuration file located in the root of your repository. The code that goes into this file, can be generated with the "Analysis configuration" page which contains the following widget:

![BCH Config](yml.png)

You can find this page by first clicking on the ‚öô icon and then clicking on "Analysis configuration". 

The resulting configuration file might look like:

~~~~
exclude:
- /mylibrary/src/.*
component_depth: 1
languages:
- java
- solidity
~~~~

Of course, you can create the configuration file directly, and place it to the root of your repository. For details check the [configuration manual](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/configuration-manual).

* **Solidity** in your repo? To analyze that languange too please add [- solidity] to the configuration file as shown in the example above.
