**Where**: [Athinais Cultural Center](http://www.athinais.com.gr/en/).

### About The Contest  

**From 3 May to 19 May**, you can improve your public or private codebase while using Better Code Hub to get refactor candidates. 

**During Voxxed Days Athens** - we will announce the coders who where able to improve their codebase best by looking at their Better Code Hub badge. 

**Winners will be awarded with Power Packs** - including a Better Code Hub license, Quality Software Development (QSD) exam voucher and hard copies of O'Reilly books ‚ÄòBuilding Maintainable Software‚Äô and ‚ÄòBuilding Software Teams - to really get you going on writing future-proof code. 


### If you're on GitHub you're good to go 

* **Public** repo? Just go to [bettercodehub.com](https://bettercodehub.com) and login [FREE] with your GitHub account.

* **Private**? Share your Github handle to get [PRO] access. Before the event: e-mail your name and personal GitHub handles to [bettercodehub@sig.eu](mailto:bettercodehub@sig.eu). During the event: come to the SIG booth.

### How to register for the contest
To _register_ the participants of the contest we use a scoreboard. To be on that scoreboard please send us a Pull Request with your Better Code Hub Badge code [here](https://github.com/voxxeddaysathens/voxxeddaysathens.github.io/blob/master/voxxeddaysathensscoreboard.md). After five o'clock on Friday May 19 we will no longer accept your Pull Request.

### How to get started! 

With Better Code Hub, you can check how good your team's code scores compared with the state of the art in software engineering. If Better Code Hub says you're compliant (‚úÖ) then it means you're performing like the top teams in the industry. It checks for compliance with 10 guidelines for Maintainable Software. 

![10 guidelines](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1440/1*TS-ZTeI7sQS7dy_AlMqSXQ.png)

The guidelines are described in full in the book [‚ÄúBuilding Maintainable Software‚Äù](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049159.do) Compliance to the guidelines is derived from the Software Improvement Group's industry benchmark (8 billion lines of code, over 180 technologies). 

## Supported Languages

![Languages](languages.png)
For a full list of the supported technologies, including Solidity, check [here](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/configuration-manual).

## Zero set-up time

Using Better Code Hub is easy. Just head over to [bettercodehub.com](https://bettercodehub.com) and login with your GitHub account. You'll then see your repos, and you can start an analysis clicking the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button. 

If you want Better Code Hub to run for every Push and Pull Request on your repo, click the ‚öô icon and toggle the switch:

## Excluding files from analysis

Better Code Hub analyses all the code that is in your repository. This might include all the external libraries that you use. 

First do an initial analysis of your repository, so the "Analysis configuration" option becomes available. Then you can exclude these files by creating a **.bettercodehub.yml** configuration file located in the root of your repository. The code that goes into this file, can be generated with the "Analysis configuration" page which contains the following widget:

![BCH Config](yml.png)

You can find this page by first clicking on the ‚öô icon and then clicking on "Analysis configuration". 

The resulting configuration file might look like:

~~~~
exclude:
- /mylibrary/src/.*
component_depth: 1
languages:
- java
- solidity
~~~~

Of course, you can create the configuration file directly, and place it to the root of your repository. For details check the [configuration manual](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/configuration-manual).

* **Solidity** in your repo? To analyze that languange too please add [- solidity] to the configuration file as shown in the example above. 


## Support and PRO License
